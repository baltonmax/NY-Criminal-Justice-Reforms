					<h2>Raise the Age</h2>
					<p>New York was one of the last states to treat 16- and 17-year-olds as minors. It was possible for those under 18 to be tried as adults which could send minors to Rikers alongside adult offenders.</p>

					<p>New legislation raised the age of criminal responsibility to 18. Last October 16-year-olds could not be tried as adults and this past October 17-year-olds were added to the list. The aim is to provide alternatives to incarceration for the younger offenders, supporting them so they are less likely to return to the system.</p>

					<h2>Bail Reform</h2>
					<p>Judges can sentence bail to those on trial based on the gravity of the crime they’re accused of and whether or not they’re a flight risk. This leads to a jail population of the least financially stable, unfairly favoring wealthy New Yorkers.</p>

					<p>In the new year, reforms will end cash bail, putting fewer people in jail while they await trial. The hope is to slow recidivism by allowing more people to return to their communities while creating a more equitable system where money doesn’t decide the jail population.</p>

					<h2>Discovery Reform</h2>
					<p>Discovery is the process in which prosecution and defense transparently present relevant documentation to the court. This way, all information is out in the open as a case begins.  
					</p>

					<p>Come January, Legislators seek to provide more transparency to the system by adding more to the list of required documents. Changes to the process will force both sides to produce this expanded information sooner than they had in the past. </p>

					<h2>Close Rikers Campaign</h2>
					<p>Rikers Island has been at the center of the conversation on criminal justice reform in the past few years. Reports of inhumane conditions and treatment were bulwarked by statistics of rampant recidivism.</p>

					<p>While no formal plan has been approved, the city hopes to close the beleaguered facility and replace it with four borough-based jails. These facilities will each house about 4,000 individuals while the city aims to reduce the jail population by supporting alternatives to incarceration. </p>
